# city_explorer_api

**Author**: Joshua Beasley
**Version**: 1.0.3 

## Overview
I am building an API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer Application, allowing a user to search for a location, present a Map, as well as interesting information about the area, all using data from APIs that this server will fetch and manage.

## Getting Started
I am building a server that will reveive a search queiry from the user. Then connect that search quiery with the corelated map and weather data, then return that data back to the client in the format in which it requires. 

## Architecture
This server/app uses node, express, cors, and superagent.

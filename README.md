# city_explorer_api

**Author**: Joshua Beasley
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
I am building an API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer Application, allowing a user to search for a location, present a Map, as well as interesting information about the area, all using data from APIs that your server will fetch and manage.

## Getting Started
We are going to build a server that will reveive a search queiry from the user. Then connect that search quiery with the corelated map and weather data, then return that data back to the client in the format in which it requires. 

## Architecture
This server/app uses node, express, cors.

## Change Log
I got the first feature working at 6pm.
second feature done around 7:30pm
and the third at 8:15pm.
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.

# city_explorer_api

**Author**: Joshua Beasley
**Version**: 1.0.2 

## Overview
I am building an API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer Application, allowing a user to search for a location, present a Map, as well as interesting information about the area, all using data from APIs that this server will fetch and manage.

## Getting Started
I am building a server that will reveive a search queiry from the user. Then connect that search quiery with the corelated map and weather data, then return that data back to the client in the format in which it requires. 

## Architecture
This server/app uses node, express, cors, and superagent.

## Change Log
I got the first feature working at 6pm.
second feature done around 7:30pm
and the third at 8:15pm.
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
I got succesfully connected the location api and my app with the front end website at 3:45 pm July 14th 2020.
